## Music recommendation app based on DL

## Overview
This project aims to serve as a full-cycle web application that enable users to discover music based on users preference. A deep learning model is trained to capture the digital features of the music input, and outputs a list of tracks with similar digital representation. Recommender system that suggests artists and music is constructed with collaborative filtering and alternating least squares methods.
